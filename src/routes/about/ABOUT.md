_\*\* We express our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed to the Chinese word-by-word Quran translation, particularly Brother Ma Zhiren for his meticulous translation work completed in 2014, Brother Adam Voo from Malaysia, and Brother Usama Nonnenmacher for digitalizing the data, as well as Brothers Max Ma from Canada and Suleyman Abdullah from China for their collaboration. May Allah reward them all abundantly in this world and the hereafter. We pray that Allah blesses our Chinese brothers and sisters through the Quran app._

_\*\*\* Original sources for the Malayalam translations are [Amani Thafseer](https://amanithafseer.com) and [Lalithasaram](https://www.lalithasaram.net/). For the Amani Thafseer translation, Brother Usama Nonnenmacher assisted in formatting the data and adjusting word splitting where knowledge of Malayalam was not required. Brother Ameen Abdussalam, whom he collaborated with via the Amani Thafseer team, provided crucial support for cases needing Malayalam expertise. Regarding the Lalithasaram translation, minimal adjustments were necessary beyond converting the format from an SQL file to a standard database file._
